Retirement is a time when you can finally relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor. But in order to have a comfortable retirement, you need to start planning early.\
Here are a few tips on how to invest for retirement:

1. **Start early.** The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow. Even if you can only invest a small amount each month, it will add up over time.
2. **Choose the right investments.** There are many different types of investments available, so it is important to choose ones that are right for you and your risk tolerance. If you are not sure where to start, you may want to consult with a financial advisor.
3. **Re balance your portfolio regularly.** As you get older, your risk tolerance may change. It is important to re balance your portfolio regularly to ensure that it is still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Here are some examples of investments that you may want to consider for retirement:

1. **Stocks**: Stocks can provide high returns over the long term, but they are also more risky than other types of investments.
2. **Bonds:** Bonds are less risky than stocks, but they also offer lower returns.
3. **Mutual funds:** Mutual funds are a type of investment that pools money from many investors and invests it in a variety of different assets. This can help to reduce risk and diversify your portfolio.
4. **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs):** ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they trade like stocks on an exchange. This can make them more liquid and tax-efficient than mutual funds.
